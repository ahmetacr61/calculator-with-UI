# calculator-with-UI
A Calculator in Java with Javax.swing (JFrame).
This was a just for fun project so don't expect the code to be perfect, but it works so I'm happy with it.
I would recommend you to use JS instead of Java because there it is (in my opinion) a lot easier to create a calculator with an UI and the Interface looks a lot better due to CSS. But if you are a newbie and want to challenge yourself than a calculator in Java could be an interesting project.
